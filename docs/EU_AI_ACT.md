# EU AI Act Notes

## Provider Model

CrossCheck is designed as a **hybrid provider**: it both develops AI-enabled components and integrates third-party models where appropriate. This places the organization in a dual role with obligations for model development, deployment, and downstream integrations.

## High-Risk Classification

The recruitment and hiring use case is **high-risk** under the EU AI Act. CrossCheck must therefore:

- Maintain a risk management system and documented governance.
- Implement data governance and quality controls.
- Provide transparency and documentation for intended use.
- Enable human oversight and contestability.
- Ensure cybersecurity, robustness, and accuracy.
- Maintain logs and enable post-market monitoring.

## Compliance Planning

- Maintain technical documentation for each system release.
- Track model provenance, dataset lineage, and evaluation metrics.
- Define and test human oversight procedures for recruiters.
- Provide clear user-facing disclosures and explanations.
